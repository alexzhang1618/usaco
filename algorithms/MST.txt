Minimum Spanning Trees
  The smallest tree that spans a graph

  Tree - No cycles, so MSTs is finding a tree that spans all the      nodes and has the least number (Length of sides added)

Prim's MST Algorithm
  - Add the closest vertex to what we currently have, choosing the smallest ones
  - Takes the n smallest edges for n nodes

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (O (n^2))
  - Returns a list showing the shortest paths from a vertex for each node
  - starts from beginning vertex 
     - spans every neighbor and checks if number is smaller, adding previous distance and distance to node
  -May or may not work with negative edges
  
Kruskal's Algorithm
  - finds minimum spanning tree based on edges
  - goes from smallest edges to largest edges to find minimum spanning tree
    - Once a cycle is created, the algorithm ignores the side which creates the cycle
        - (using union find) Checks if starting vertex and ending vertex are both in the group of connected nodes
  - Runs until n - 1 edges are added
